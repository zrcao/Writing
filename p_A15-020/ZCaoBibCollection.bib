	Abstract = {This paper investigates the application of blind and semi-blind interference alignment methods in clustered small cell networks. First, we examine two simple straightforward extensions of blind interference alignment and observe that neither of them is uniformly superior under all user distribution. Then, we exploit the location information of the users and base stations (BSs) in the cluster to define the semi-blind interference alignment problem, whose objective function is to minimize the supersymbol length by grouping the users that can be served in the same time slot. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose two heuristic centralized algorithms that can provide effective solutions. The first scheme, top-level semi-blind supersymbol design, employs a grouping indicator matrix to determine the supersymbol while the second scheme, ordered semi-blind supersymbol design, constructs the supersymbol in an ordered and greedy fashion. Finally, we propose a more decentralized scheme which does not have the location information of all users and BSs in the cluster, but the BS utilizes the long-term SINR values, obtained via feedback, of each user it serves. By numerical simulations, we show that the proposed semi-blind algorithms perform uniformly better than pure blind interference alignment schemes for any possible user distribution scenario.},

	Abstract = {For the fully connected K user wireless interference channel where the channel coefficients are time-varying and are drawn from a continuous distribution, the sum capacity is characterized as C(SNR)=K/2log(SNR)+o(log(SNR)) . Thus, the K user time-varying interference channel almost surely has K/2 degrees of freedom. Achievability is based on the idea of interference alignment. Examples are also provided of fully connected K user interference channels with constant (not time-varying) coefficients where the capacity is exactly achieved by interference alignment at all SNR values.},

	Abstract = {Interference alignment is a revolutionary wireless transmission strategy that reduces the impact of interference. The idea of interference alignment is to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at the receivers, facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques. Since interference alignment's inception, researchers have investigated its performance and proposed several improvements. Research efforts have been primarily focused on verifying interference alignment's ability to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom (an approximation of sum capacity), developing algorithms for determining alignment solutions, and designing transmission strategies that relax the need for perfect alignment but yield better performance. This article provides an overview of the concept of interference alignment as well as an assessment of practical issues including performance in realistic propagation environments, the role of channel state information at the transmitter, and the practicality of interference alignment in large networks.},

	Abstract = {Military dismounted communications are critical to the success of missions and safety of soldiers, and hence are strongly regimented and hierarchical. Certain situational awareness apps have been introduced, where content is exchanged between soldiers in a squad, but soldiers primarily carry any needed content out with them and bring any collected content back to base. Furthermore, soldiers rarely share content among themselves or with other squads, and any readily needed content must be retrieved through an expensive "reachback" link to base. We present CASCADE, a content-centric networking architecture that facilitates generation and dissemination of content based on soldiers' interests, both statically assigned (e.g., specialty within the squad) and dynamically discovered (i.e., derived from context). The key enabling abstraction within a CASCADE network is the concept of communities. Through the use of both topological and interest-based communities, CASCADE is able to quickly and efficiently deliver content, even in environments prone to disruption.},

	Abstract = {Situational awareness applications in disaster response and tactical scenarios require efficient communication without a managed infrastructure. In principle, the performance, size, weight, and power of commercial off-the-shelf mobile phones and tablets are sufficient to support such applications, provided that efficient protocols and mechanisms are put in place for the efficient and secure sharing and storage of content among such devices. ICEMAN (Information CEntric Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) is a system that allows applications to request content objects by their attributes, and integrates its API with utility-based dissemination, caching, and network-coding mechanisms to deliver content. ICEMAN is implemented based on the Haggle architecture running in the Android operating system, and supports distributed situational-awareness applications operating in networks subject to severe disruption. Its functionality is described, and performance results of the ICEMAN implementation running in mobile phones and the CORE/EMANE network emulation are presented for several test scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The tactical edge is filled with rich content, providing real-time intelligence and situation awareness to the warfighter. The current network architecture lacks support for lateral sharing of this critical content. Content is currently accessed from known servers and may require reach-back over bandwidth-constrained links. In this work we present SCALE, a Scalable Content-centric Architecture ensuring Locality and Efficiency. SCALE focuses on sharing data as it is created and is optimized for ad hoc collections of mobile nodes, rather than defined clients and servers. Any node can create and share content and nodes can discover content without knowing ahead of time where to look for it. SCALE provides mechanisms by which content is replicated throughout the network by organically caching content as it transits through the network or prepopulating content caches for existing content. SCALE provides a distributed index based on multi-node resolution, in which nodes dynamically take on responsibility for subsets of the content index based solely on being in a particular geographic location. We provide an evaluation of SCALE's mechanisms for providing local content discovery and sharing based on a SCALE prototype running on Android devices. These results show that SCALE can improve the probability that content is available locally and decrease the number of hops needed to access content. Dynamic ad hoc content sharing apps (e.g. social networking, microblogging, photo sharing, search, chat channels, etc.) can be built on top of SCALE to provide enhanced situation awareness and command and control operations for mobile tactical users.},

	Abstract = {The current Internet architecture was founded upon a host-centric communication model, which was appropriate for coping with the needs of the early Internet users. Internet usage has evolved however, with most users mainly interested in accessing (vast amounts of) information, irrespective of its physical location. This paradigm shift in the usage model of the Internet, along with the pressing needs for, among others, better security and mobility support, has led researchers into considering a radical change to the Internet architecture. In this direction, we have witnessed many research efforts investigating Information-Centric Networking (ICN) as a foundation upon which the Future Internet can be built. Our main aims in this survey are: (a) to identify the core functionalities of ICN architectures, (b) to describe the key ICN proposals in a tutorial manner, highlighting the similarities and differences among them with respect to those core functionalities, and (c) to identify the key weaknesses of ICN proposals and to outline the main unresolved research challenges in this area of networking research.},

	Abstract = {Mobile Backbone Networks are heterogeneous wireless networks in which a subset of the nodes are more capable than others. The more capable nodes are referred to as Mobile Backbone Nodes (MBNs), whose primary role is to provide a mobile infrastructure in order to facilitate reliable end-to-end communication between nodes in the Network. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally placing the MBNs over a finite time horizon. Specifically, we consider the path planning of a single MBN and aim to maximize the time-average system throughput. We present a discrete problem formulation, and develop an optimal solution for the single step velocity-constrained MBN placement problem. Using this as a sub-routine, we provide a greedy heuristic algorithm for the overall path planning problem. Next, we develop a dynamic programming based approximation algorithm for the problem. Finally, we compare the developed approaches via simulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes new algorithms for throughput optimization in a mobile backbone network. This hierarchical communication framework combines mobile backbone nodes, which have superior mobility and communication capability, with regular nodes, which are constrained in mobility and communication capability. An important quantity of interest in mobile backbone networks is the number of regular nodes that can be successfully assigned to mobile backbone nodes at a given throughput level. This paper develops a novel technique for maximizing this quantity in networks of fixed regular nodes using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The MILP-based algorithm provides a significant reduction in computation time compared to existing methods and is computationally tractable for problems of moderate size. An approximation algorithm is also developed that is appropriate for large-scale problems. This paper presents a theoretical performance guarantee for the approximation algorithm and also demonstrates its empirical performance. Finally, the mobile backbone network problem is extended to include mobile regular nodes, and exact and approximate solution algorithms are presented for this extension.},

	Abstract = {We study the novel hierarchical architecture of Mobile Backbone Networks. In such networks, a set of Mobile Backbone Nodes (MBNs), which are envisioned to be airborne, are deployed to provide an end-to-end communications capability for the terrestrial Regular Nodes (RNs). We address the joint problem of placing a fixed number K MBNs, and assigning each RN to exactly one MBN, using two optimization objectives. The first is the Maximum Fair Placement and Assignment (MFPA) problem in which the objective is to maximize the minimum throughput obtained by any RN. The second is the Maximum Throughput Placement and Assignment (MTPA) problem, in which the objective is to maximize the aggregate throughput of the RNs. We develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the MFPA problem for any K, and an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the MTPA problem for K≤ 2. We also develop lower complexity approximation algorithms and present simulation results comparing the performance of the various algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We study a novel hierarchical wireless networking approach in which some of the nodes are more capable than others. In such networks, the more capable nodes can serve as mobile backbone nodes and provide a backbone over which end-to-end communication can take place. Our approach consists of controlling the mobility of the backbone nodes in order to maintain connectivity. We formulate the problem of minimizing the number of backbone nodes and refer to it as the Connected Disk Cover (CDC) problem. We show that it can be decomposed into the Geometric Disk Cover (GDC) problem and the Steiner Tree Problem with Minimum Number of Steiner Points (STP-MSP). We prove that if these subproblems are solved separately by gamma- and delta-approximation algorithms, the approximation ratio of the joint solution is gamma+delta. Then, we focus on the two subproblems and present a number of distributed approximation algorithms that maintain a solution to the GDC problem under mobility. A new approach to the solution of the STP-MSP is also described. We show that this approach can be extended in order to obtain a joint approximate solution to the CDC problem. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulation and show that the proposed GDC algorithms perform very well under mobility and that the new approach for the joint solution can significantly reduce the number of mobile backbone nodes.},

@article{Tang2006490,
	Abstract = {Scalability and extended lifetime are two critical design goals of any large scale wireless sensor network. A two-tiered network model has been proposed recently for this purpose. This is a cluster-based network model composed of relay and sensor nodes. Relay nodes are placed in the playing field to serve as cluster heads and to form a connected network topology for information dissemination at the higher tier. The relay nodes are capable of aggregating data packets from the sensor nodes in their clusters and transmitting them to the sink node via wireless multi-hop paths. In this paper, we study the relay node placement problem in large scale wireless sensor networks. Our objective is to place the fewest number of relay nodes in the playing field of a sensor network such that (1) each sensor node can communicate with at least one relay node and (2) the network of relay nodes is connected. However, placement strategies realizing goals (1) and (2) do not provide any fault-tolerance as the network may lose functionality after failure of some of the relay nodes. In order to incorporate fault-tolerance in such a network, we ensure that every sensor node is able to communicate with at least two relay nodes and the induced network topology is 2-connected. This strategy will ensure survivability of the network in the event of single fault, in lieu of higher relay node placement cost. We formulate the relay node placement in wireless sensor networks as two optimization problems: (i) Connected Relay Node Single Cover (CRNSC) problem and (ii) 2-Connected Relay Node Double Cover (2CRNDC) problem. We present two polynomial time approximation algorithms to solve the \{CRNSC\} problem. We prove that the ratio of the number of relay nodes needed by the approximation algorithm to the number of relay nodes needed by the optimal algorithm is bounded by 8 for the first algorithm and 4.5 for the second. In addition, for the 2CRNDC problem we provide two approximation algorithms with performance bounds 6 and 4.5, respectively. },

	Abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the DoD to build an on-demand airborne network for communications relay utilizing high capacity, long-range military radio systems. While these systems operate well in a network of homogeneous systems, platforms generally employ multiple heterogeneous radio systems making internetworking difficult due to varying radio characteristics and lack of interoperability. Although simulations and emulation tests can provide a baseline for how systems will perform in a controlled environment, field-tests are crucial to demonstrate capabilities in real-world operating environments. In this paper, we present measurement results from a field test involving two airborne platforms forming a dynamically routed aerial IP backbone over 200 nautical mile (Nm) with various radio systems as part of the C4ISR 2010 exercise. We present measurements results on per link performance, radio-to-router interface performance, and multi-hop network performance results with prototype software on open source platforms.},

	Abstract = {The Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate, in Dayton Ohio, has a mission ``To lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable sensor technologies for our warfighters.'' Within this functional mission, the USAF is witnessing a worldwide revolution in technologies related to Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. While ``commercial off the shelf'' wireless components help the USAF rapidly create and field ISR capabilities in months that once took years, the universal availability of cell phone and publically interconnected cameras and sensors are forcing the USAF to rethink traditional ISR paradigms altogether. Our nation's ability to deter international criminal and transnational violence will depend on our ability to produce a Globally Integrated ISR (GI-ISR) capability that rapidly provides decision makers with timely information.},
